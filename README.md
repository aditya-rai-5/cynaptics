# Cynaptics
  Hello, I am Aditya Rai. Here, I am working on the tasks assigned for the induction into the Cynaptics club.

## Subtask 1
  In this task, we need to create a model that classifies whether an image is real or AI-generated. For this, I have used the ResNet50 model.

## Subtask 2
  In this task, we need to create a GAN model capable of generating images. This involves creating two models:

    Generator: This model generates images from random noise.
    Discriminator: This model classifies whether the generated image is real or fake.
  Our main goal is to minimize the generator loss and maximize the discriminator loss to improve the performance of the models. Additionally, the discriminator is also       used for the task in Subtask 1.

## Subtask 3
  In this task, I have created a day-night theme using CycleGAN. This involves two generators and two discriminators. And applying the concept of cycleGAN to transform       images between day and night themes.
